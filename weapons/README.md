The data in this directory is compiled from the following sources:    

* `countries_weapons.js`: FDI statistics [published](https://dipp.gov.in/publications/fdi-statistics) by the Indian Department of International Trade. 
* `sipri_trade_registers.txt`: Weapon trade statistics from the ledgers maintained by the [SIPRI](https://www.sipri.org/databases/armstransfers) arms transfer database.
* The `Profit` tab of the map was generated by comparing the amounts in the SIPRI ledgers for the same weapons/source and different destination (eg: P8A-Poseidons sold by the US to Australia), except in cases where a more thorough analysis of the specific deal had already been performed by a reputable source (eg: the [Rafale deals](https://caravanmagazine.in/tag/rafale)).
