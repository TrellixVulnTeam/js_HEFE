Lun heard a thump in the darkness.
_Lights_

'Lights, please'. A cold sharp voice. 
_What sort of an asshole *asks* for lights._

'Sorry to disturb you'.
_A polite home invasion. All civil like. How Cute._

'Oh.. Sorry to relieve your bladder might've been more apt. 
I'm still figuring this out you see.'

She could feel the dampness in her thigh. Judging from the stench it most 
definitely wasn't her period. 
_Control yourself. You're in the people's army for godsake!_

Lun suddenly realized she couldn't move. 
_Can I talk?_
She coughed.
_Probably_

'I.. can't move. Have you paralyzed me?'  

'Yes, I'm afraid. I was afraid.'

'Do you realize I'm an admiral? What have you done?'.  
She tried to flex her fingers. Nothing. 
_No pain. That's good._ 

'Nothing I can't undo. Please activate the lights.'

'You've already tripped the alarm. If I don't deactivate it in 10 
minutes the military police will come through.'
_And see you pissing yourself._

'I'd love to meet more of you firma. But I'm positive I didn't trip anything.'
_Meet more of me?? Fuck, a pervert? in her bunker?_

'I'm sorry you have the wrong pod. Firma is two down. 우박 히틀러.'

'I'm sorry I don't understand. And why should I.. "hail hitler"?'

'I just tripped the alarm asshole.'

'It is best you reverse it.. for your own sake.. you see.. I really would 
prefer you to _see_.'

'Bich'
The lights came on, voice activated by her accentuated Korean. 

'Isn't that much better? Do you see now?'

Lun looked around. She was in a single room bunker. Empty. The bathroom was 
locked from the outside. 

'I'm in your head.'
_Well fuck, it was bound to happen sometime._
_No. Think. You're sane, you can't move, you have a voice you can't locate. 
Keep him talking._

'Am I going to wake up or meltdown?'

'I don't understand.. a joke?'

'I'm either asleep or completely off the rails right?'

'Ah, no, neither. You fear madness. I did too. I was afraid I'd root you into 
it. I'm glad you can still reason.' 

'Are you God?'

'I wish. Gods.. gift, maybe'
_So the devil's asshole himself_

'The truth is.. I crash landed on your planet. I had to eject into your body. 
It's now my life support system.'
_omg omg omg I'm actually and finally fucking losing my head_

'You have two options: I can either leave you here paralyzed and find another 
host or we can co-habit. Once again, I do apologize, terran atmosphere is 
hostile to our kind.'
_or 3. I blow my brains out and kill us both_

'I agree to co-habitation. Can I have my limbs back?'

'Excellent. But you are forgetting something. I'm in your head, Firma. And 
shooting yourself won't kill me.'
_Hands!_
Lun rolled in bed. Stood up. 

'Now I'll need you to self-augment your Oculus so you can perceive my 
dimension. It will lead to a sort of blindness in one eye.'

'Ok first things first, I'm not "Firma". I'm Lun. And secondly, I am not 
performing eye surgery on myself.'
_Do I have a choice?_

'I assure you, it's safe. In fact, every "blind" Firma isn't really blind. They
can only perceive wavelengths from our dimension, which their brains can't
process.'

The military police burst through Lun's door.
