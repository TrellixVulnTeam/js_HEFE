* Quantative questions, high precision measurements 
* Petabytes / night! complex simulations!
* What instruments gather astronomy data?
  - Magnus Supercomputer 
* Faint signals from pulsars, below noise level of 1 image
  - Stack images together using averaging
  - Add all images to increase signal strength
  - Median more robust than mean
  - Bring down cluster 

* Computation problems from textbooks
