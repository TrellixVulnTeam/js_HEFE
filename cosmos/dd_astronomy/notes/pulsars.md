# Pulsars

## Neutron stars 

* 1967 Joycelyn Bell
* Radio Astronomy data: 
  - 1.3 seconds blip
  - LGM-1
* 1930 explanation for supernovae
  - Neutron (1932) sub atmoic particle
  - Old large star runs out of nuclear fuel it collapses under its own gravity 
  - Rapidly collapses into a dense bowl of neutrons
  - Outer layers bounce off into an explosion
  - Neutron star = 3,2 suns squeezed into the radius of a city
  - Too dim to see with a telescope
  - Stars rotate
  - Rotation speeds up when it collapses (conserve angular momentum - no
    external torque)
  - Stars have a magnetic fields, when a star collapses it takes the magnetic
    field with it. NS have intense magnatic fields. The metals in the stars are
    funneled to the magnetic poles and shot into space. 
  - Pulsars are the beams of a spinning neutron star sweeping across the earth. 
  - Charges produce magnetic fields (compass deflects when placed near wire?)

Supernova: 
  - Mass of 2,3 suns
  - Exhausts nuclear fuel, collapses under it's own gravity
  - Dense core of neutrons, outer material blasts outward

2 effects:
  - intense magnetic fields
  - fast spin
  - Beams of spinning start only sweep across the earth ever so often

The reason we get pulses is because their rotational and magnetic axis aren't
aligned. 

## Images: MWA (Mercherson wide field array telescope)

* Image stacking
* 80-300 mhz (radio radio freq from outerspace)
* Flux density measured in Janskies w/(m^2 * Hz) spectral power
  - If m^2 is 1 the telescope has unit area and the Janskies measures
    power/frequency (spectral power)
* Astro objects are very very faint compared to cellphones (sun at 10Ghz is 1/100th)
  - Crab pulsar: 1.4 GHz 10 billionth of a phone
* Detection: flux density > 5 SD of ambient values
* Stacking images: gaussian noise cancels, signals add
* FITS images
