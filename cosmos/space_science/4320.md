* Cosmic dust detection on ESA Rosetta, NASA Cassini
* Python packages: NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib/spirit for Near Earth Objects (NEO)
    - NEOs revolve around sun on orbits within 0.3 AU (1AU is earth:sun)
* SPICE (Spacecraft Planet Instrument C-matrix Events)
    - position/velocities of objects: expansion? 
    - transformation between coordinate systems (planetary / ecliptic?)
    - spacecraft orientation
    - attributes of planetary bodies
    - Actual software in c/matlab/java? wrappers for python?
