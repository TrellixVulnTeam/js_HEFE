# Quantum world

* Einsteins revolution - SR/GR
* Quantum mechanics

## Quantum Determinism (discreteness)

* EM waves at the quantum scope consist of photons
* Photons are basically quanta of energy given by `E = hc/Lambda`
* h is planks constant `6.6 x 10^-34`
* Is light a particle of wave? 
  - When there's a large amount of light (100W bulb 10^19 photons/sec) it's a
    wave
* Classical mechanics: electrons spin around the nucleas of protons
  - Maxwell - charged particles + curved trajectories radiate EM waves 
* Quantum mechanics: only certain orbits are possible. If the electron radiates
  energy it only jumps orbits. 
  - The configuration of these orbits leads to spectroscopy: atoms of an
    element can only absorb in certain wavelengths. 
  - The electrons don't just randomly radiate, they give out quanta of energy 
  - Same formula for the quanta as E = hc / lambda

## Quantum Non-Determinism

* Heisenberg: d(x) d(v) > h/(4Pim)
* Very small particles deviate from classical mechanics (it's hard to have a low
  certainity with high mass - ie we don't need < h/m for planets)
* In the quantum world, a hill is just an energy barrier like the orbits of an
  atom. A ball is as likely to materialize on the other side of a hill as the
  electron is to drop orbits. 
* Alpha radioactivity: something holds the nucleas in tact. Sometimes something
  overcomes this barrier and emits an alpha particle with charge +2. 

### Wave functions 

* Encode the probability of finding a particle at a point (at rest) 
* Schrodinger's equations give the wave function of a particle 
  - Also predicts the decay probability per unit time
  - On inspection the wave function collapses into one of another state
  - If you keep checking it'll fall somewhere on the curve, randomly
* Einstein didn't accept quantum indeterminism

As absurd as the many worlds interpretation is, cosmologists favor it because
the Copenhagen interpretation requires an external observer to perform
experiments. Cosmology's foundation is that there is no one external to the
universe.
