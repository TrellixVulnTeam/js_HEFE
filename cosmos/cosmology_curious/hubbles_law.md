# Hubble's Law/Expanding Universe

* Slipher - spectra of spiral nebulae (galaxies)
  - most of them were redshifting away from earth at 1000 kmps
* Hubble plotted Slipner's redshift estimates vs his bright stars observation
  - Hubble's law is _based_ on the redshift. He said it's moving faster because
    it's redshifting. All he said was, further away galaxies appear to be
    redshifting like mad, and BTW moving things also redshift. 
* A more interesting curiosity is that distant galaxies are different. They have
  shorter lived stars. Frequent super novae. 

## Hubble's relation

* Hubble law: Speed of galaxy moving away from us and the distance to that galaxy. 
  - `v = H_0 * d`
  - `H = 2,2 * 10^-18 x^-1` quite a tiny number so distances have to be huge
* Hubble set out to investigate this but Cepheids were unusable
  - Redshifting galaxies had only faint Cephids
  - But they had brighter stars
  - So hubble measured Cephid galaxy brightest stars and calculated loss in
    luminosity as a new standard candle
* We're not in the center of an explosion, everyone thinks the universe is
  expanding away from them. 
  - rubber band marks expand slow on the inside and fast on the outside. 

## Expansion explantions

* Steady State Theory: matter is constantly created out of vacuum at slow rate.
  - We now see distant galaxies have short lived bright stars
  - CMB is everywhere, and came from initial heat flare of the big bang
* Scale factor: current separation `d = a(t) * d_0`
  - The stretching happens at some linear rate a(t) 
  - for present a(t)=1; big bang a(t=0) = 0
  - Hubble factor = rate of change of a(t)/current a(t)
  - Constant in space, varies with time; this is why it's not Hubble's constant

## Scale factor

`d=a(t)d_0`

* `d_0` is a constant, distance now
* differentiate both sides wrt to time, d(d)/dt = v
* `v = d(a(t))/dt d_0`
* Since H = v/d, H = `d(a(t))/dt d_0` / `a(t) d_0` = d(a(t))/dt / a(t)
* If the scale factor is progressing as t=1,a(t)=2,t=2,a(t)=8 and t=1.2? 
  - we'd have to differentiate the function behind a(t) i.e a(t-1)x4
  - If we know the a(t) function we can find H
* Wavelength is also stretched by a(t) since space is stretched
  - If it's wavelength hadn't stretched (i.e more space was just added) it's
    color wouldn't have changed 
* Redshift is z = `(Lambda_0 - Lambda) / Lambda` 
  - but `Lambda_0 / Lambda` = 1/a(t)

## Cosmological Redshift

* Galaxy spreading out according to a scale factor that varies with time
* As light waves move through spreading space, their wavelengths elongate
  proportionaly
* Calculate rate of expandion according to hubble's v=Hd
  - H is computed from redshit in wavelength
* Why is Hubble period and expansion rate varying?
  - Initially it was deceleration because of gravity
  - Then it started expanding
  - Can stick the hubble formula into s=d/t and figure out 14b years as age
    because the 2 effects cancel (it's actually 13b years) 
  
## Hubble distance

* Galaxies far enough away can be expanding at faster than light speed
* plug v=c in the v=Hd equation and solve for d, 14b ly
* Particle horizon: in the beginning the edges receeded faster than light so we
  just can't see past our own age
* We've moving out at a speed, rewind that and we were very close. There's
  nothing that says there was nothing else out there at the time. 
* The light from the thing moving away from us faster than the speed of light
  just had to be 13b years from us when the universe started expanding - the
  the thing itself could've been 46b years. 
* We were also pushed out of the big bang. Light was also pushed out of the big
  bang. Light that left the big bang moving out was curved back to us because
  space was stretching (7.7)
* Cosmic horizon: 46b ly, we can't see that galaxy today we can see it at the
  big bang. 
* Comoving galaxies don't expand relative to each other. Andromeda and the
  MilkyWay will collide in 4b years. Fields stretch. Light stretches.
  Electric-Magnetic waves stretch. But things bound together by gravity don't.
