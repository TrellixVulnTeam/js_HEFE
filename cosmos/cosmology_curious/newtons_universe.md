Principia: laws of motion explain everything from the tides to the planets and
comets to projectil trajectories. 

* First law: law of intertia. 
    - discovered by Galileo and adopted by Newton.
* Second law: f=ma, applying force translates to acceleration
    - 1 Newton is the force needed to accelerate 1k at 1m/s^2
    - frame of reference for velocity: ground vs lap on plane
* Third law is inconsequential (equal and opposite reaction)

Hypothesized that launching a cannon really fast will hit him from behind. 
* Law of gravity: F = GMm/r^2
    - `G = 6.67*10^-11 Nm^2/kg^2`
* Shell theorem proof: 
    - all the mass of an object is concentrated at its center as if it's a shell
    - point masses inside the shell, not at the center, won't feel the pull
    - Invented calculus to prove this, had to imagine millions of point masses
* Acceleration in free fall
    - mass vs weight
    - Weighing scale measure F = GMm/r^2 where one M is earth's weight and the r
      is earth's radius because all the weight is concentrated at the center.
        a. This is why we'd obviously weight less on the moon
        b. Why is this obvious? 
            - Our bodies contain the same number of atoms
            - The moon is smaller in radius
            - The moon is smaller in mass 
            - so M/r^2 of earth > M/r^2 of moon, no so obvoius!
    - Another throwback to Galileo, he figured out the a = GMm/r^2 * 1/m result
        a. Everyone accelerates towards the ground at the same speed, 9.8ms^2
        b. If you drop something from a height, after 2s it will be at 19.6m/s 
        c. Doesn't matter what it's mass is, only earth's radius and mass
* Orbits
    - Running at uniform velocity on a circular track: accelerate to change
      direction: a=v^2/r
    - centripetal acceleration is directed toward the center of the circle track
    - Planets follow elliptical orbits because of inverse square law
    - v=2Pir/T
    - Weight of the sun can be found by equating GmM/r^2 = mv^2/r
    - `M_sun = 2*10^20 kg`
    - radius to sun measured through parallax experiments, geometry and
      telescope
* Escape velocity
    - Nature's ultimate currency, for a rocket: chemical -> kinetic
    - Mechanical energy: kinetic and potential
    - Kinetic is by virtue of motion (k=1/2 mV^2)
    - Potential is undefined and based on the interaction 
        a. For gravitational: U=-GMm/r between 2 speheres
        b. For small objects and earth: mgh
    - In isolated systems, all energy is one or the other. Typical example is 
      a ball on a roller skating track.
    - As the earth comes closer to the sun it's negative gravitational potential
      energy converts to kinetic energy. But it also has centrifugal force, like
      cannonball fired from earth. mv^2/r = GmM/r^2, so the outward centrifugal
      force counters the inward gravitational force.
    - Escape velocity is computed the same way. GmM/r^2 = 1/2mv^2. 11.2m/s^2. 
* Olber's paradox: why aren't we seeing stars everywhere at night? This is the
  problem with Newton's universe. It is static. Stars don't collide because
  they're pulling each other and not moving, but a slight perturbation will
  disrupt them.
