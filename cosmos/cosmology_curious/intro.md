## Philosophers studying cosmology

* Pythagoras: calls heavens cosmos, bodies around a fire (6bc)
* Thales: no god, only rules for "matter" (6bc)
* Democritus: atoms make up "matter"
* Epicurus: atmos + randomness (3bc)
* Ptolemy: _Almagest_.
  Epicycles explained movement of spheres in the sky: one planet moves in a 
  small circle. The center of that circle, revolved around a larger circle all 
  with the earth at the center. 
* Copernicus (16th century): _on the revolutions of celestial spheres_.
  Ironically this theory couldn't match Ptolemy's Almagest. The real achievement
  of Copernicus was removing the Earth from the center. 
* Kepler: elliptical orbits based on his advisors data. Sun was one foci, the
  other was empty. 
* Newton: _the principia_
* Edwin Hubble: galaxies are rushing away from each other at high speed. 
* Most of what we know was discovered in the last century. The big bang was
  14 billion years ago. Andromeda is one of our closest galaxies, arond the 
  same size, 2.5 million ly.
* Penzias and Wilson: _CMB_. 
  Cosmic Microwave Background radiation bathing the whole universe. Microwaves 
  are a subset of radio waves. 

By 1970 the major mysteries of the big bang were outlined. 
Sources of data made it reputable in the 80/90s: 
* VLA: Very Large Array
* COBE: Cosmic Background Explorer satellite

## Brief history

Big bank - 1minute (nuclei) - 400k yeras (atoms) - 1-10b years(stars+galaxies
- heavy metals) - 14b years

The combination of atomic nuclei with electrons took 400k years. It formed
atoms. At this point the universe became transparent to light and the CMBR was
formed.
