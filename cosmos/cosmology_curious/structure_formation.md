# Structure formation

* Stars -> galaxies -> galaxy clusters -> super clusters 
* Galaxy types: spiral, elliptical, irregular 
  - Spiral - huge dark matter halo and spiral arms
  - milky way - 10k ly across, halo = 10x disk size
  - sun is not in the galactic center, 25k ly from it 
  - milky way has 100b stars
* MW cluster is called Local Group (40 galaxies)
  - Andromeda also in it, 2.5m ly away 
* Next closes cluster is Virgo (60m ly, 1000 galaxies)
* Clusters grouped into SuperCluster (100s clusters)
* Largest structures are 300 million ly in size, large than this we have
  homogeneity in the unierse. 
* CMB is homogenous at 380k years, but quantum fluctuations resulted in 
  structure formation
  - Only tiny fluctuations are needed to create gravitational instability
  - Gravitational instability causes matter to become lumpy

## Assembling Structure 

* 3 eras: radiation, matter and vacuum. We're in the vacuum. 
* Density fluctuations only really begin at teq 60k years when matter era starts
  - before that photons get trapped like in the sun, and there are no atoms
  - gas initially has a high pressure, so gravity loses. Gravity only wins at
    high mass. 
  - dark matter has a head start here, grows right after `t_eq`. Dark matter
    particles are very intert. 
  - Dark matter is basically influenced only by gravity. 
  - dark matter starts clumping and finally drags atomic matter.
  - Galaxies form around dark matter clumps.
  - 5 billion years ago - vacuum era - accelerated expansion
