# Special Relativity

* Special = neglect gravity
* General = theory of gravity
* Einstein didn't prove Newton wrong, just that Newtonian physics has a limited 
  scope (to things travelling much slower than light). 
* Core ideal of relativity comes from Galileo's Dialogue (1632)
    - shut yourself in a cabin in a ship, which way is it going
* The earth moves at 30km/s and the solar system moves around the galactic
  center at 230 km/s
    - Speeds on earth are relative to this frame of reference
    - What frame of reference for things that leave earth? eg: light
* Sound is different from light. 300m/s in air. Sound doesn't travel in a vacum. 
    - Scifi films where they use sound to identify occupied rooms. 
    - Light leaves our galaxy in a vacuum
* Ether postulation: ether:light as air:sound, light travels at 300000kmps wrt
  to the speed of ether on the earth. 
    - Michelson from Case School and Morley of Reserve College
    - Measure speed of light 6 months apart, if the earth was moving through the
      ether (vs air that moves with the earth) the speeds should be different,
      because the direction of the earth's travel reverses in 6 months
* James Clerk Maxwell and electromagnetism
    - Static charges, currents (flowing charges)
    - Ubiquitous forces: earth's magnetic field. Compass reveals it. Caused by
      currents. Current in a coiled wire produces magnetic field.
    - Maxwell's equations are 8 in number and describe all electro magnetic
      interactions. 
    - EM waves are oscillating electric magnetic fields flowing through air at
      300k km/s
    - Recognizing the number he thought light was a EM wave. EM waves have a
      wavelength and a frequency. 
    - f=c/L where L is lambda the wavelength and f is frequency of any EM wave.
    - EM waves: 10^2 (radio) - micro, infra, colors, uv, x, 10^-12 (gamma)
    - Classical physics: light is a wave; Quantum physics: light is a photon
      particle. Use one or the other depending on what light is interacting w/.

## Einstein essentials 

_Simultaneity_: Simultaneity has no absolute meaning. Even if the speed of 
light is constant, the back wall of a moving train will see the light reach 
before the front when it's turned on. 

_Time Dilation_: time is measured in terms of distance light travelled. This
time can be dialated depending on the observer. Standing outside the train, the
time is stretched because each time period of the reflecting light beam between 
the mirrors is travelling a longer distance. 

Imagine an alien species out there training a telescope on the galaxy. Every 1
year the telescope clicks a picture of all the light that's fallen on it from 1
light year away. Since it wants to capture the galaxy, it clicks at this rate.
Hence our 1 year is a single instant for this telescope. 

Even if these aliens took clicks at a constant 1s interval they'd not get linear
events. To capture linear events they'd have to account for the spin of our
galaxy and solar system and earth. Their telescope clicks would have to vary
according to the equation: 

```
t=Gamma t_0
Gamma = 1/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2 - lorentz factor)
```

Lorentz factor shows that things moving faster than light will have negative
time dialation. That alien telescope will think the event occurred before.
Typically (in the train example) the time dialation is 1s in a million years.

Lorentz factor +10 => time flows 10 times faster on the platform (earth), and
the spaceship is moving at 99.5% c. Time is slowed down for you. All the
chemical processes that rely on electromagnetism are slowed down. 

Length also goes through the same lorentz transformation.

### A matter of perception

* 209 mass of electrons
* Unstable and decays into other particles in 10^-6 second
* When accelerate at close to the speed of light it reaches the end of a 1k
  tunnel. 
* When moving closer to the speed of light, the collisions that cause the decay
  will take longer because the collidee is also moving that fast. In the normal
  version, the collider was emitted at c and the collidee was at 0, so the
  distance was covered in pico seconds. 
* It is a matter of percepiton: 
    - If speed of light is constant, the clock speed in the muon is slower
    - If clock speed is constant in the muon, speed of light is not constant
      (i.e the light in the muon is speed up by the moving muon)
* The confusing part is just that there is a mathematical relationship between
  how much slower this decay happens (biological slowdown) and how much closer
  to the speed of light you are. This is the lorentz transform.  
* S=D/T, if we consider S=c=constant, the other two must vary to compensate. 
    - If we allow all 3 to vary, we can't account for things like decaying muons


### Reformulatin of E=mc^2

* Eneryg and mass can be converted to each other with the Lorentz transform. 
* `E=Gamma * m_o * c^2`
* For velocities much smaller than the speed of light we can apply a classical
  mechanics approximation of the formula that uses the kinetic energy of the
  object in motion `E=m_0 * c^2 + 1/2m_0*v^2`
* The m in mc^2 is not your mass

## Minkowski and space/time

* Space/time is 2d. Pythogrean theorem still applies. 
* Vertical axis is ct because c=1, and everything appears simultaneous
    - Really c is just a scale factor 
    - Light is 45 degrees on the space-time graph
* Depending on where you are on the space time graph people might disagree on
  causality
    - absolute future/past, no disagreement regardless of speed 
    - grey zones are up for debate because they're observed at c
    - these can get mixed up if you surpass the speed of light? i.e you do a
      drawing that emits light faster than c, then an observer might think it
      was done before you were born
