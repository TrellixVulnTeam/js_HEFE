# Fate of the Universe

* Will the universe expand forever, or will it start to collapse? 
  - Depends on the density
  - If there's enough dense matter that gravity overcomes expansion, it'll
    collapse (big crunch)
  - Otherwise, stars grow farther apart till no new ones can be formed and the
    existing ones run out of fuel (heat death)

## Critical Density

* Some particle at the edge of the universe. Simplistically, it's in motion so
  it has kinetic energy, and it's a mass so it has gravitational potential 
  energy `E = (1/2 mv^2 - GMm/R)`
* The Density is calculate as the mass inside Radius R sphere. This particle is
  at the edge of the speher. The sphere has some density `P`. So we can replace
  M with `4pi/3 * R^3 P`
* Also from Hubbles law the velocity of that particle is HR (same radius of
  sphere R)
* If we believe the theory of energy conservation, then `P_critical = 3H^2/8PiG`
  - This looks like a bunch of constants but it's a time dependent value
* So plugging in the best estimates for H, we find that only 6 protons / m^3
  needed for the big crunch. What's the current density? 

## Density Parameter

* Ratio of `O=P/P_critical`
  - O < 1 => universe less dense, gravity loses
* O <>=1 corresponds to different topologies. O > 1 results in curved closed
  space (sphere - recollapses). O=1 results in flat expanding space. O<1 results 
  in hyperbolic space (expands forever). Flat space is a delicate balance.
