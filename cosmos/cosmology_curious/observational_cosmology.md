# Observational Cosmology

* light consists of EM waves with a wide range of wavelengths
  - we know this because of prism experiments
  - hot gas -> light -> prism produces emission lines
  - light -> cool gas -> prism produces absorption lines
* Absorption and emission spectrum are unique per element (fingerprint)
* What elements are in a star judged by what emission light from the star

## Standard Candles and size of the universe

* light moving towards us looks like it has a shorter wavelength
  - away: red, toward: blue
  - a human perception, the star is still producing the same number of
    vibrations per second. The eyes are receiving more than those number of
    vibrations per second.
  - redshift = D(Lambda)/Lambda = v/c
* We only need one sample of light from a star, to compare it with a source of
  similar elemtns and measure redshift. 
  - Line patterns tell us which elements are present. If a line isn't present,
    it isn't because it's redshift is so high.
  - Redshift tells us how fast the star is moving away from us. 

### Parallax: 100 light years 

* Bernard star - near enough for 2 photos to give us speed
  - light from 2 successive measurements reaches us in a few years
  - parallax angle: distance between eyes (orbit of earth) and distance to 2
    observations at an angle. Using these we can calculate real distance.
  - parsec: 3.3 LY, distance at which a star would have 1 parallax
  - Parallactic angles are tiny, so impossible for 100 LY away, not to mention 2
    observations would take 100 years

## Cephids: 10m light years 

* Luminosity is energy per second, brightness is luminosity over area
* As light moves away from the source it spreads. If it has enough luminosity /
  enery, it can reach very far. That's why our entire galaxy can see most of the
  stars. 
  - If we know the initial luminosity, and the current luminosity, we can
    determine the spread. Light spreads on a sphere of area `4 pi d^2` where 
    d is distance from source. 
* pulsate in brightness, but there's a math relationship between luminosity and
  pulsation period too - Henrietta Leavitt

## Type 1a Supernovae: billions of lightyears

* White dwarf + thermo-nuclear explosion. White dwarves are typically stable
  (sun). 
  - white dwarf collapse by sucking material from a companion star so gravity
    from mass overwhelms the negative pressures inside the star. 
  - collision of 2 white dwarves. 2 masses exceed stability threshold. 
* All type 1a supernovae have roughly the same peak luminosity. We can observe
  the brightness. So we know the distance. 

## Extragalactic astronomy

* Whats outside our SS: stars + nebulae
  - 1. Nothing outside our galaxy. Nebulae are sites of star formation in the
       galaxy. 
  - 2. Island universes outside the galaxy, i.e either they're close and 1 star
       or far and 100s of stars.  
  - Debate between Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis (1920)
  - Edwin Hubble: nebulae are island universes outside the galaxy
  - Measuring the distance was key, because Hubble showed that they contained
    100s of other stars
