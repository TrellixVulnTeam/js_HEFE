# Static universe

Einstein made some assumptions to apply GR to the universe. 

## Einsten's assumptions

* At very large scales the universe is well approximated as being perfectly
  homogenous and isotropic (there are of course star densities etc)
  - For H&I there has to be randomness. Regular lattice looks different on
    diagonals
  - In reality, galaxies form clusters which form superclusters, 150m LY across
  - Smoothed over 300m LY the homogenous isotropic nature is more apparent (how
    does the smoothing work?)
* On hyperbolic space being [isotropic](https://www.lapasserelle.com/cosmology/lesson_3.pdf)
  - Circle is 1d (points) but it needs to be embedded in 2d to view it as a
    circle
  - Nested 1-spheres on a 2-sphere looks like an expanding disk to a 2d radian
    astronomer at the south pole
* 3 possible space/time curvatures (another s/t hyperboloid [page](http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/cosmo/lectures/lec15.html)): 
  - Circle: parallel lines always converge, positive curvature
  - Euclidean: parallel lines never converge, flat curvature
  - Hyperboloid: parallel lines diverge, negative curvature
* The topology of the universe can be anything, but if space/time is any of
  these shapes it will look homogenous and isotropic. 
* If there are different curvatures at different points (cube) it will not look
  isotropic. 

## Einstein produces static spherical space-time

Tl;dr: The universe looks the same at all places, from all directions, at all 
times i.e it is homogenous, isotropic and invarianti (avg density of stars don't
change). The GR equations have no solutions with this static universe. Instead 
of entertaining the idea of a non-static universe, he modified the GR equations
to endow vacum with energy and pressure. How else to account for massive
gravities that disrupt the static universe?

* GR: energy <-> mass <-> gravity
  - vacuum has no mass
  - If it has energy, it can produce repulsive gravity (i.e negative pressure)
  - Vacuum energy is getting cycled out of mass in stars at the same rate as
    which the stars mass and hence gravity is increasing

* Energe density of the vacuum `p_v` is a constant everywhere (cosmological
  constant)
  - vacuum also has a pressure, `P_v` = -`p_v`
* Normally, in ordinary non-vacuum matter, the gravity only depends on mass
  (energy according to SR) but in vacuum pressure has same magnitude as energy
  density. 
  - Vacuum has enery density, matter has matter densit that gets converted to
    energy density nearing the speed of light
* Vacuum pressure is repulsive (-`p_v`) i.e it is _tension_. 
  - Gravitational attraction of matter cancels gravitation repulsion of vacuum
* This produced a static spherical curvature of space-time.

## Against static space-time 

* Problem with this model is that heat death can happen, stars radiate energy
  but they can't pull other stars together and form new galaxies. Everything is
  stationary, the system is closed, all things attain the same temperature. 
  - Heat death can happen if the universe expands too fast as well. So fast that
    gravity between stars no longer work. 

## Friedmann's expansions

* Hyperbolic space and expanding universe 
* Big bang - expansion - Big crunch
* How did Hubble discover that the universe is expanding?
