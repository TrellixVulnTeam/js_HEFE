# Hot Big Bang

* Gases cool down when they expand
  - loss in kinetic energy manifests in a decrease in temperature
* The interesting question is not when does air stop being a gas, it's when does
  matter cease to exist? As the scale factor gets tinier the chemical bonds that 
  hold atoms break
* At `10^12` nucleons (protons and neutrons) break into elementary particles
  (quarks)

## Thermal Radiation

* EM waves fundamentally consist of photons 
  - energy of photon inverse to its wavelength `E=hc/lambda`
  - photons are emitted and absorbed by electrically charged particles 
  - They're emitted on collision too
* As the temperature of the gas goes up it's wavelengths go down hence their
  energy goes up 
  - Blue is the most energetic gas by this logic
* At the normal heat of a human the peak wavelengths emitted is infrared
  - At the normal heat of the sun the peak wavelengths emitted are red/orange
  - Black body radiation is just thermal radiation. Absorbs all visible light,
    emits energy in the form of heat to equalize the energy it got from color. 

## Hot Big Bang: model

* 10^9K, 1m: Nucleosynthesis: forming atomic nuclei
* 3000K, 380,000y: Recombination: neutral atoms from electron + nuclei
  - this is when the universe because transparent to radiation
  - if we look farthese away, we can see light emitted at this state at some
    place that's inflated away from us really fast 
  - Recombination was key because photons are absorbed by charged particles 
  - Photons emitted in the sun could take millions of years to make it to the
    surface, but once at the surface, reach the earth in 8 minutes. 
  - the universe at 3000k can be observed all around and is called the surface
    of scattering
  - The sky is blue because the surface of scattering is red and it is getting
    redshifted as space stretches and it arrives to us from 14b years ago

## CMB: The Primeval fireball 

* CMB measured in microwaves, i.e it was emitted with some color but got
  redshifted at the wavelength now is 2mm
  - image from 380k years old universe which is now at least 14b years old
* Primeval fireball measured by COBE at ~3K showing the early universe to be
  isotropic and homogenous
* The CMB image that looks like a yin/yang is just because our galaxy is moving
  and the doppler effect kicks in
* The CMB pic with the red streak down the middle is because of the microwaves
  emitted by our galaxy
* Fluctuations could also be evolving galaxies
* The images produced by lower resolutions satellites also looks different
  - Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE - 1989)
  - Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP - 2001)
  - Plank satellite (2009)
* Luckily we can't see microwave or we'd be blind, CMB radiation photons are
  around us at the same density as a full moon.
  - `n_y = 4*10^8 m^-3`, lot more photons than nucleons /m^3
* CMB wavelength increases as universe expands, and energy decreases 

## Reverse calculating scale factor

* We know avg energy of photon from CMB measurements
* Photon energy decreases with wavelength
* Temperature decreases with wavelength and energy
* We know current temperature and temperature at time when universe became
  transparent (recombination): 3k and 3000k
  - `T/T_0 = 1/a`, a at `T_0` was 10^-3 if a today is 1
  - 1000x growth since recombination

## Cosmic Eras

* Temperature moves down by wavelength directly, but energy density moves down
  by volume and wavelength (redshift)
  - energy density dilution `p_y ~ a^-4` - this dominated in radiation era (1st
    60k years)
  - matter density dilution `p_m ~ a^-3` - this dominated in matter era  (next
    7b years)
    - Both these eras the horizon grows linearly, since there is more attraction
  - vacuum energy density constant - this dominates today (last 5b years)
    - In this era the universe starts expanding faster than the speed of light
* Energy density dominated by dark energy (repulsive)
  - matter that generates this dark energy is 26% dark 5% atomic
