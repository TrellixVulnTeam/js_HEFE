* Newton's laws are incomplete if t and r vary according to lorentz transform.
  Especially in equations where gamma doesn't cancel itself, like GMm/r^2.
  Classical physics only applies to a given instant of time and for observers
  with the same inertial frame of reference. 
* Galileo: all objects fall at the same rate regardless of their mass. 
    - Because of this, if an elevator string breaks, objects in the elevator
      will fly. 
* Einstein: Gravity distorts space/time the same for all objects. The objects
  are just falling towards the distortions center. 
* Euclid: properties of space deduced from pure reason
    - fifth axiom: given a straight line, you can draw only one parallel line to
      it through a given point in the same plane. 
* Gauss
    - Hyprebolic geometry
    - Shape of the earth
    - Geodesic lines connect points on the curved surface
    - Triangles on the surface don't add up to 180
    - Euclid geometry is a special case of such curved geometry at scales small
      enough for the rules to apply. 3D text-book space is euclidian. 
    - 3D speherical vs 3D euclidean space: Problem with space time is that it's 
      homogenous and isotropic, looks the same from all directions,
      indistinguishable from typical euclidean space because of its astronomical
      radius.
* Gravity as light source in 2D
    - There are still lines in 2D, just that the lines of uniform length across
      the sphere in 3D take on varied lengths in 2D.
    - Conversely the distance between the center and one line is different than
      the other. Conversely the intensity of light at those points is different. 
    - In 3D, we bloat out the sphere so the bright spots grow dim.
    - We can't visualize higher dimensions, but can we reformulate the inverse
      square law for them? For this we need `tensors`. 
    - What the general relativity equation shows (the one with the Reiman tensor
      on the LHS) is that space-time de-curvature due to gravity would also
      spread only at the speed of light. Newton would have it happen instantly.
* General relativity equation reproduces inverse square law with slow motion and
  weak fields (related concepts). It can be used to correct Newtonian physics
  and predict Mercury's precession angles.
* Gravity x light deflection:
    - Eddington: Measure a star twice, once with its light passing by the sun
      and once when it's not. The first time, light should get distorted by
      curvature introduced by the mass of the sun (bending of starlight). 
    - Similar observations made with lensing galaxies. Source - galaxy -
      observation, the observer sees an "Einstein ring", because the same beam
      of light is warped around the same galaxy on either side.  
* Gravity x time dialation:
    - Satellite clocks run slower because of velocity based time dialation and
      faster because of being far away from earths gravity. 
* Black holes: Schwarzschild radius, escape velocity = c
    - Schwarzschild radius is the radius of the sphere that needs to conatin all
      the matter in the current sphere for that escape velocity (1cm for earth). 
    - `R_s = 2GM/c^2` where `M = D x v` so it's different for differently dense
      stars (for the sun it's 3k)
    - People at the event horizon are frozen because light is stationary there.
      Close to the center you die because gravity is non-uniform and varies.
      Between the event horizon and the center, you can live for a long time
      (depnds on the Schwarzschild radius).
* Gravitational Waves: Caused by massive objects moving. Accelerated charges
  generate Em waves, accelerated masses, gravitational waves. 
    - GWs don't interact with matter much. 
    - General relativity can predict energy to GW conversion. Matches stars that
      orbit each other and the time taken for them to spiral. 
    - Detected with the LIGO telescope (Laser Interferometer) from a 3x sun size
      inter-stellar collision 1.3 billion years ago. 
    - GW are in a new spectrum. 
    - Gravity is the thing we get when large masses collide and convert their
      enery to waves. At small scales it follows an inverse distance law.
