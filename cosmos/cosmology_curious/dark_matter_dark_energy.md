# Dark Matter and Dark Energy

This is why measuring universe density is hard. When trying to do it, we
discovered dark energy. 

## Naive approach

* Add up masses of all galaxies. Divide by Volume. 
  - Masses computed from galactic luminosity 
  - This will only give us star density
  - `O_stars=0.005` << 1 meaning heat death? 
* Dead stars, blackholes, space dust etc all have mass
* We can calculate the masses of some of these things by observing things around
  them
  - If a mass M is orbited by an object at radius r with velocity v, we can
    figure it out (regardless of the orbiter mass, which should be small or
    they'd crash into each other).
* If we see a star rotating around the center of a galaxy (like ours) we can
  figure out the mass of the galaxy

## Dark Matter

Evidences 
* Orbits not falling off
* Gravitational lensing
* Speed of galaxies in clusters


* Solar system rotation: orbits get slower farther away from the sun. Neptune is
  at 30 AU and only moves at 10kmps but earth moves at 30kmps. 
* Things rotating around the galaxy reach a peak velocity as we widen the orbit.
  More and more mass in included in wider orbits. Near the edges of the galaxy,
  velocity actually platues at a high level. 
* The velocity platue exists to some unseen boundry: dark matter halo around a
  luminous galaxy. 


* What are we actually measuring here: hydrogen gas disks rotating around the
  edges. The gas emits radio waves. We measure doppler shift. 
* Ch4: distortion of light by mid-way galaxies. The mid-way galaxies mass can be
  measured using the parallax in the measurement of the farther galaxy. 


* Galaxy clusters are another big evidence of dark matter. Atmospheres are bound
  to the cluster by gravity. The bound atmosphere is much larger than the
  visible mass. 
* Even more surprising is that the atmosphere sometimes _pulls_ stellar mass. 

* Dark matter cannot be normal atmoic matter. Must be exotic matter. Must be
  stable. 
  - `O_dark_matter = 0.26`
  - `O_net = 0.31`

* This still suggests that the universe is open, hyperbolic and will never
collapse.
